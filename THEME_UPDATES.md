# Realistic Windows XP Theme Updates

## Visual Enhancements Applied:

### 1. Window Controls (Minimize, Maximize, Close)
- **Authentic Look**: Replaced flat text buttons with CSS-generated 3D buttons.
- **Gradients**: Used specific linear gradients to match XP's "Luna" theme.
- **Colors**: 
  - Close button: Red gradient (#E86E56 to #C73823)
  - Other buttons: Blue gradient (#488CF6 to #2662D8)
- **Interaction**: Added hover (brightness) and active (depressed) states.

### 2. Title Bar
- **Gradient**: Applied the correct 7-stop blue gradient used in the original XP title bars.
- **Text**: Added a subtle drop shadow to the white text for better contrast.

### 3. Taskbar
- **Buttons**: Taskbar items now have a bevel effect and look "pressed" when the window is active.
- **Start Menu**: Updated the header gradient to be smoother.

### 4. Desktop
- **Background**: Switched to a professional "XP Blue" radial gradient (#004E98) as a reliable fallback for the Bliss wallpaper.
- **Typography**: Enforced `Tahoma` font family across the entire OS for pixel-perfect authenticity.
- **Scrollbars**: Custom-styled scrollbars to match the beige/blue theme.

## How to Verify:
1. Open the app.
2. Open any window (e.g., "My Projects").
3. Hover over the window control buttons (top right).
4. Check the title bar gradient.
5. Look at the taskbar button for the open window.
